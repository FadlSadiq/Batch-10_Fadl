#Background
Each player begins with 8000 LP (Life Points). If your LP hit zero, you lose!
• If you have Fusion Monsters (purple cards), like Thousand Dragon, place them in the Fusion zone.
• Your Deck needs to contain between 40 and 81 cards. Your Extra Deck, if you have any Fusion Monsters, can be between 0 and 5 cards.
• Shuffle the cards in your Deck together before the Duel (but not your Extra Deck).
• You can’t have more than 3 copies of the same card in your Deck.
• Each player chooses 1 Skill Card before the Duel and places it face-down in front of them.
• Flip a coin at the start. The winner gets to choose to go first or second. If you go first, don’t draw a card on your first turn.
• Each player draws the top 7 cards from their Deck for their starting hand.
The Duel is played in turns. At the start of your turn, draw a card. Then you can Set Traps, play Spells, and Summon a
monster, in any order. After all that, you can attack. When you are done attacking, your turn ends, and now it’s your opponent’s turn.
During your turn, you can Normal Summon 1 monster from your hand, in Attack Position (upright), or Set 1 monster facedown in Defense Position (sideways). Count the monster’s Level Stars when you Summon it. If it has 4 or less Level Stars,
then you can just Summon or Set it. If it has more than 4 Stars, you need to Tribute a monster you already have in play
first, by sending it to the Graveyard. You need to Tribute 1 monster to Summon or Set a Level 5 or 6 monster, or Tribute 2
monsters to Summon or Set a Level 7 or higher monster. If a card effect says to Special Summon a monster, you don’t need
to Tribute unless the card effect says to. Also, Special Summons are “free” so they don’t take up your 1 regular Normal
Summon/Set during your turn, and can even sometimes be done during your opponent’s turn!
Monsters with yellow borders have no special abilities, but are good at battling. Monsters with orange borders have
special abilities – just follow what the card says. Monsters with blue borders, like Relinquished, cannot be Summoned
except by using the Spell explained on the monster.
You can play Spells right from your hand to the Spell & Trap Zone. Just follow the card directions. If it’s a Field Spell ,
place it in the Field Zone. If a Spell or Trap has an Equip or Continuous symbol, it stays in play in the Spell & Trap
Zone. All other Spells and Traps go to the Graveyard after you do what the card says.
Traps are not played face-up during your turn. Instead, you Set Traps face-down in your turn. Then on any turn after
that (yours OR your opponent’s turn), you can flip them face-up and use their effect, then send them to the Graveyard.
This lets you do a surprise move!
Each of your Attack Position monsters can attack once per turn. Pick a monster for it to attack, or if your opponent has
no monsters, you can attack their LP directly. Subtract your monster’s ATK points from your opponent’s LP. If you battle
an opponent’s monster, refer to the chart on the right to see what happens! If you attack a face-down monster, flip it
face-up, and if it survives the battle, it stays face-up.
These are just the basics. You can find out some more cool moves, and learn about advanced things like Quick-Play Spells
